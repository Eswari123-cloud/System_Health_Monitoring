**System Health Monitoring**
Overview
System Health Monitoring is a Python-based application designed to track and visualize the performance and health of servers. The project includes functionalities for database management, data import, real-time visualizations, and notifications. It features a web dashboard built with Dash for interactive monitoring of server metrics.

Features
Database Management: Create and manage a SQLite database for storing server details.
Data Import: Import server information from CSV files into the database.
Sample Data Generation: Generate synthetic data for testing and visualization.
Real-Time Visualization: Interactive web dashboard to monitor CPU, memory, and disk usage.
Anomaly Detection: Visualize system metrics to identify potential anomalies.
Automatic Cleanup: Manage disk space usage with automated cleanup processes.
Notifications: Send alerts and reports via email and Microsoft Teams.
Installation
Clone the Repository

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
Install Dependencies Ensure you have Python 3.7 or higher. Install the required packages:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Database Setup

Create the SQLite database and table:
python
Copy code
from database.db_utils import create_table_if_not_exists

db_filename = 'servers.db'
create_table_if_not_exists(db_filename)
Import Server Data

Prepare a CSV file (servers.csv) with hostname and ip columns.
Import data into the SQLite database:
python
Copy code
from database.db_utils import insert_servers_from_csv

csv_filename = 'servers.csv'
insert_servers_from_csv(csv_filename, db_filename)
Run the Web Application

Start the Dash application:
bash
Copy code
python app.py
Usage
Access the Web Interface

Open your web browser and go to http://localhost:8050.
Use the dropdown menu to select a server and view real-time data visualizations.
Dashboard Components

Line Charts: Display CPU, memory, and disk usage over time.
Bar Chart: Shows average usage of CPU, memory, and disk.
Gauge Chart: Provides a visual representation of disk usage.
